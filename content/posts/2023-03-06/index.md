We are happy to announce that we have secured speakers and a location for the March 2023 AWS User Group DFW meetup!

## Session Overview

Windows containers adoption has been increasing over the past years because today, companies need to deploy, coexist, integrate, and maintain two parallel environments in their current IT footprint:

The Modern Infrastructure comprises serverless, containers, IaC, GitOps, and DevSecOps and usually lives in the cloud.
The Legacy infrastructure comprises technologies that usually power their most critical workload in the company but rely on Virtual Machines and Baremetal servers.
There are many rumors about full-stack Modernization, but the true reality is that legacy infrastructure will continue to exist for years to come for many reasons. Therefore, professionals looking to help their company succeed with the cloud and modern infrastructure adoption will need to know when and how to blend the legacy and the modern infrastructure to reduce cost and achieve operational excellence. Windows containers play a crucial role in this space, allowing companies to reduce costs by moving applications from the legacy to the modern infrastructure, with low code change and offering a better application per server ratio, thereby decreasing Windows Server license costs in the long term

## Who should attend

Solution Architects, DevOps Engineers, SysAdmins

## Why should you attend

Running applications in containers is the new normal for modern applications, but how about the critical legacy ones? Did these have a spot in the container world? Come and learn how to run legacy .NET Framework applications on Windows containers on AWS.
